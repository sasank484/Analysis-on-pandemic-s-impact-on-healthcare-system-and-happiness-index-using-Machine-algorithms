## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on **global healthcare systems** and the **World Happiness Index** using **machine learning algorithms**. The study aims to analyze changes in healthcare infrastructure, medical services, and overall well-being pre and post-pandemic. It integrates multiple datasets, applies various regression and classification models, and provides insights to improve healthcare resilience for future pandemics.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Investigate **healthcare system changes** before and after the pandemic.
- Analyze the correlation between **COVID-19 impact and the Global Happiness Index**.
- Use **machine learning algorithms** (classification, regression, and ensemble methods) to study patterns in healthcare services.
- Develop predictive models to understand **factors influencing healthcare quality and happiness scores**.

## 📂 Dataset Sources
The study integrates data from multiple sources:
1. **COVID-19 Data Repository** – Johns Hopkins University.
2. **World Happiness Report** – Kaggle dataset.
3. **Vaccination and Healthcare Data** – Our World in Data.

## 🏗️ Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Merging COVID-19, healthcare, and happiness index datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding trends and key influencing factors.
3. **Regression Analysis** – Evaluating the relationship between GDP, healthcare spending, vaccination rates, and pandemic impact.
4. **Classification Models** – Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Comparison** – Identifying the most accurate model for predicting healthcare efficiency.
6. **Visualization** – Data trends using **Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: 
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data Processing
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly` – Data Visualization
  - `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` – Machine Learning Models
  - `PySpark`, `Spark MLlib` – Big Data Analytics
- **Cloud Platforms**: Google Colab

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Healthcare system strain**: Countries with **robust healthcare infrastructure** showed higher resilience.
- **Happiness Index**: Countries with higher **vaccination rates** and **economic stability** had better happiness scores.
- **Best Performing ML Model**: **Random Forest + Bagging Decision Tree** outperformed other models in predicting healthcare resilience.
